How can we convert more than 2 files of typescript into a JS file at a time ?

Note : We cannot run typescript file directly on browser.
       
what is type inference ?

IMP - can we define the function type is undefined ?

**Void - 
  void means nothing / blank

what is difference between unknown and any ?
